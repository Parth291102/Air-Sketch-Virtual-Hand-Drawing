# AirSketch: Virtual Hand-Drawing

## Overview

AirSketch is an innovative application that enables users to draw in the air using hand gestures and have their sketches mirrored onto a digital canvas. This project leverages computer vision techniques for object tracking and real-time hand gesture recognition, making it applicable for e-signatures, air-to-text conversions, virtual whiteboards, and creative digital art.

## Features

- **Real-Time Hand Tracking**: Uses OpenCV to detect and track hand movements.
- **Air Drawing**: Draw on a virtual canvas using hand gestures.
- **Color Selection**: Supports different colors for drawing.
- **Clear Screen Functionality**: Provides an option to erase the canvas.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Converts gestures into digital sketches or characters.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV** (for computer vision and real-time tracking)
- **NumPy** (for array handling and image processing)
- **Collections** (for managing tracking points efficiently)

## Usage

1. Start the application using `python AirSketch.py`.
2. Hold a colored object (blue by default) in front of your webcam.
3. Move the object in the air to draw on the virtual canvas.
4. Use the on-screen buttons to change colors or clear the canvas.

## Future Scope

- Implement multi-color hand tracking.
- Improve gesture recognition accuracy.
- Develop a GUI for enhanced user experience.
- Extend functionality for text and shape recognition.
